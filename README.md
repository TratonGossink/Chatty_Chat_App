# Chatty_Chat_App
SwiftUI chat app with Firebase database networking. Includes user authentication and camera usage. 

### About
This app was a part of my online iOS development course taught by Chris Ching through Code with Chris Academy. This app has features and functions for a new user to use such as: create an account, log in to that account, chat with existing contacts on their device, group chats, add a custom profile photo, dark mode,
delete their account and create new chats. This app still needs push notifications for recieving messages, verfication code through via email or phone, along with some other personal functions. 
This app was the biggest and most complicated app that I have developed yet. There was extensive SwiftUI coding that used inline 
conditionals, dynamic programming and many new to me features of SwiftUI. This project also incorporated Firebase Firestore for the database storage. Being how recent this course was made, I learned many new and applicable methods, tools and techniques 
to apply to my future career in iOS development.
